                In the summer of 1992, the Sun Gym Sports Club in Miami looked like a thriving enterprise. According to the records, more than five hundred people regularly trained there, but in fact everything was not so rosy: one by one, customers flowed into the new Gold's Gym sports complex, 
                recently opened in Miami Lakes. No wonder: if there was a cult of brute force and focus on results at Sun Gym, 
                Gold's Gym was mostly a place for a pleasant hangout, which, of course, was more to the liking of people who did not set themselves the goal of winning 
                the title of Mr. Olympia (and 99 percent of such in gyms).

                <span class="moreText">
                    The Sun Gym was owned by 57-year-old John Meese, who was a professional bodybuilder
                     in his youth, and even took first place at the British Championships in 1962. Since then,
                    a lot of water has flowed away, and the Miz, who received the status of an accountant and notary,
                     no longer looked like a mountain of muscles. But the passion for bodybuilding did not leave him,
                      and in January 1987, with the profit from his accounting firm, John opened the "dream gym", hoping that it
                       would eventually become a real Mecca for all bodybuilders in Florida. Since then, the Miz has regularly organized
                        local bodybuilding competitions, and all athletes who came to the competitions in Miami trained at the Sun Gym.
